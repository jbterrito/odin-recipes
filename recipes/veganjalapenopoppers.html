    <h4> Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>12 medium jalapeno peppers, sliced in half and seeded</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

    <li>1(8 ounce) package button mushrooms, finely diced</li>
    
    <li>1/2 cup finely diced onion</li>

    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <li>1(8 ounce) tub vegan cream cheese substitute, softened</li>

    <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

    <h4> Directions </h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set jalapeño halves on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, open side up.</li>

    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic to the skillet and saute until vegetables are tender and mushrooms have released their liquid, about 8 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a paper towel-lined plate to soak up the excess moisture.</li>

    <li>Mix mushroom mixture, cream cheese substitute, 3/4 cup shredded cheese substitute, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon into the jalapeño pepper halves on the baking sheet.</li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>

    <li>Remove from the oven and top with the remaining 1/4 shredded cheese substitute. Broil until the cheese is melted and slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
