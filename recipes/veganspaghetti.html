    <p>Do you have a hankering for moms Spaghetti but you remember that it was made with the grinded insides of a cow and pig? Well we have a fantastic recipe that will make your heart sing because you don't have to worry about a poor animal being slaughtered for the sole consumption of making our bellies full.</p>
    <h4> Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>11 large zucchini</li>

    <li>1/2 cup vegatable broth, or as needed, divided</li>

    <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
    
    <li>1, 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>

    <li>1 small portobello mushroom, cubed</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

    <li>2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>

    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>

    <li>1/2 (12 ounce) package veggie meat substitute (such as Yves Ground Round)</li>

    <li>2 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped</li>
</ul>

    <h4> Directions </h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cut zucchini into noodles using a spiralizer fitted with the large shredding blade. Set aside.</li>

    <li>Combine 1/4 cup broth, onion, and tomato paste in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook until onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Add tomato, mushroom, garlic, oregano, thyme, tarragon, and marjoram. Cook until the mushroom just begins to soften, about 3 minutes more.</li>

    <li>Stir veggie meat, spinach, and remaining 1/4 cup broth into the pan with the mushroom mixture. Add an additional 1/4 cup broth if the pan seems dry. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender and sauce is beginning to thicken, about 10 minutes.</li>

    <li>Stir zucchini noodles into the pan with the sauce and cook to desired firmness, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>

</ol>
