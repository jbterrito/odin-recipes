    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>One might think milkweed pods might not make for a great substitute for chicken and that one might be wholly incorrect. We started out to try and make some that could be indistinguishable to Buffalo chicken and we struggled. I happened to bump into and old friend who had changed their eating habits to be more cognizant of our choices and thier effects on the natural enviornment. After catching up they me about the milkweed pods that they have been using for quite some times to replicate the chicken breast/fingers.</p>
